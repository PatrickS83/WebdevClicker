# WebDevClicker

My take on the idle-game genre. A clicker game with a WebDevelopment Theme in 100% vanilla JS. No frameworks, no dependencies.

**Work-in-progress alpha version**

## Motivation

This game was my first bigger javascript project. It was mainly a project to learn. I had several goals:

1. Putting all the JS basics I have learned together into one project.
2. Familiarize myself with the ES6 class-syntax and code structuring
3. Experience the pro and contras of static HTML vs dynamically created HTML through JS

All in all I realized that I liked dynamically created HTML much more than static, especially in highly interactive environments. Thats why started to focus on React soon after.
